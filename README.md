# HorizonOverlay
Overlay for Horizon 5 for use with SimHub

## Wheel info Features
The overlay comes as a miniature scheme of car's wheels and drivetrain.

### Drive type
Only active axles are displayed, so it can be seen at a glance if the car is FWD, AWD or RWD.
More of a nice gimmick than something special.
  
### Springs
Bars at the outer side of each wheel display current suspension compression.
Normalized data is used so the absolute height and amplitude of the vehicle do not matter.

### Wheel temperature
From light blue to orange.
Sadly, Forza only provides average temp, so it was impossible to replicate in-game temp display for tyre zones.
  
### Wheel spin
When the wheel loses traction it will glow pink.
  
### Puddle
When the wheel is in a body of water, it will glow blue.
Outer glow effects are positioned to not interfere with eachother, so, if you are sliding in a puddle you can see both pink and blue effects.
After some testing, I realized that this only counts puddles and ocean, Wet road on a rainy day will display no effect, so this stat is not particularly useful.
